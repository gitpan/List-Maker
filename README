List::Maker version 0.0.3

    The List::Maker module hijacks Perl's built-in file globbing syntax
    ("< *.pl >" and "glob '*.pl'") and retargets it at list creation.

    The rationale is simple: most people rarely if ever glob a set of
    files, but they have to create lists in almost every program they
    write. So the list construction syntax should be easier than the
    file-name expansion syntax.

        use List::Maker;

        @list = <1..10>;                      # (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
        @list = <10..1>;                      # (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)

        @list = <1,3,..10>                    # (1,3,5,7,9)
        @list = <1..10 x 2>                   # (1,3,5,7,9)

        @list = <0..10 : prime N>;            # (2,3,5,7)
        @list = <1,3,..30  : /7/>             # (7,17,27)

        @words = < a list of words >;         # ('a', 'list', 'of', 'words')
        @words = < 'a list' "of words" >;     # ('a list', 'of words')
